### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?
* The most helpful topic to me was how to grab data from apis and dynamically display it through javascript. Previous to that lab, I felt unprepared to complete the project.
* Specially, I found it daunting to think about how much html I'd have to write to complete the app. An 'a-ha' moment was when Elias told me that I could add HTML to a tags
* innerHtml with a +=. 


* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
* If I had more time I'd definitely clean up the UI of the page. Specifically, I'd like to clean up how the modal looks when it pops up. Currently. features within the
* modal are unaligned. In addition, I'd try to do more research on how timing of api fetching works in our to create tighter synchrony within my page.
  

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
* Some of the roadblocks I had were displaying each movie's poster and embedding youtube videos within each movie's modal. Thanks to Abhiraj, I was able to find the api
* extension that was responsible for displaying each movie image. Abhiraj was super helpful in pointing me in the right direction in order to dynamically embed youtube
* trailers to each movie. Overall, I did most of my struggling in the labs, which was the most instructive point of the week. I was able to research, test ,break and iterate 
* constantly and it made the assignment way more manageable.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.
I cannot give enough shoutouts to Abhiraj, if you're reading this, you're the MVP of my assignment. I definitely would have been stuck longer if it wasn't for him.
